# Spotify
In order to analyze the data and generate insights that will help Spotify outperform its competition, we have taken inspiration from Spotify’s current system. Spotify’s current system is a combination of their exploratory analysis, their popularity prediction and lastly their recommendation system. While Spotify uses a variety of tools and metrics to create their business moat (Unique business offering) through data and algorithms, we have used Tableau for our exploratory data analysis and python to create the predictors &amp; recommenders. Throughout our project, we aim to replicate Spotify’s approach at a smaller scale. Our objective was to understand the complexities of analyzing such data and understand the non-trivial challenges that surround this approach of using data and machine learning.
